This is the main assignment for my programming course so there will be some limits set for how I can perfom things and how the professor wants us to format things. Some relevant limitations are: 

1. Constructors and functions inside classes are forbidden.
2. Files have to be opened and closed manually.
3. F string is not allowed.
4. Some python functions like min, max and sum are not allowed.
5. We have to use this weird CLI menu type thing.
6. Constants are forbidden.

This program takes in preprocessed and formatted electricity usage and temperature time and outputs them into a more desirable format and combines them. Some example files are provided as .txt files
