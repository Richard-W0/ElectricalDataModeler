This is the main assignment for my programming course so there will be some limits set for how I can perfom things. Some relevant limitations are: 

1. Constructors and functions inside classes are forbidden.
2. Files have to be opened and closed manually.
3. F string is not allowed.
4. Some python functions like min, max and sum are not allowed.
